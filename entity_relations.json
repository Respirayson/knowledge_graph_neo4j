          "summary": "Andrew Leak, a 66-year-old man from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, is believed to have killed himself after throwing two or three incendiary devices at the Western Jet Foil site in Kent last Sunday. The attack is believed to have been motivated by extreme rightwing ideology. Leak's Facebook posts contained anti-Muslim sentiments and he was known to have mental health concerns. Two members of staff at the center were left with minor injuries. 700 people were moved to Manston asylum processing center for safety reasons. An inquest into Leak's death is expected to be opened at Maidstone County Hall on Tuesday."

Gendron admitted to using an illegally modified semiautomatic rifle to target people because they were Black, and chose the store because it was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. He faces multiple federal hate crime charges, which carry the potential for the death penalty, in addition to several firearms charges. The event has led to discussions about gun control and racism in the United States."
