          "summary": "The US State Department spokesperson, Vedant Patel, has stated that the US supports efforts to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization. The US has already designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization in 2019, but there were reports in 2022 that the Biden White House might lift that designation during negotiations with Iran to revive the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal. The Biden administration has since imposed sanctions on IRGC-affiliated individuals and entities involved in Tehran’s missile and drone proliferation, as well as money laundering and other activities in support of groups designated as terrorists, such as Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis. Critics argue that the Biden administration has not vigorously enforced oil export sanctions on Iran, allowing the Islamic Republic to earn billions of dollars with shipments to China. Despite the Biden administration's efforts to restore the JCPOA, abandoned by former President Donald Trump, Iran has refused to make a deal and has increased its uranium enrichment, stockpiling enough fissile material for several nuclear bombs. Iranian officials have also threatened to shift their nuclear doctrine, an implicit threat to produce warheads. Reports indicate that France, Germany, and Britian, signatories of the JCPOA, intend to field a censure resolution against Iran at the upcoming IAEA board meeting. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Biden administration opposes such a censure, as it still holds secret talks with Tehran. The US State Department spokesperson confirmed that the US is actively increasing pressure on Iran through a combination of sanctions, deterrence, and international isolation."

The Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has demanded that the Taliban take action against the TTP, including its leader Noor Wali Mehsud, for its role in recent terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including a suicide bombing of a vehicle carrying Chinese nationals in the northwestern province.  Pakistan has long accused Kabul of failing to take action against TTP militants who allegedly hide and operate from Afghanistan."

          "summary": "A 16-year-old boy was arrested after a bishop, a priest and churchgoers were attacked during mass at the Assyrian Christ The Good Shepherd Church. At least four people suffered \"non-life-threatening\" injuries, police say. The attacker was also hurt. The incident was captured on a church livestream and quickly triggered unrest in the suburb of Wakeley. Australian police define terror offences as being ideologically motivated. Investigations are still under way, but they say they are satisfied this is a case of religious extremism. Authorities have repeatedly declined to state the religion of the alleged attacker. The church has named the priest as Father Isaac Royel and the bishop as Mar Mari Emmanuel. Ordained in 2011, Bishop Emmanuel is seen as a popular and controversial figure, whose sermons receive millions of views on social media. When graphic videos of the attack - and the aftermath - spread like wildfire online on Monday night, they drew an angry crowd to the Assyrian Orthodox Church, which is about 35km south-west of the city centre. There, hundreds of people upset over the attack violently clashed with police, who were guarding the church where the alleged attacker was being held. Two officers were injured - one suffering a broken jaw after he was hit with a brick and fence palings - and 10 police cars destroyed. The violence similarly left paramedics fearing for their safety and \"holed up\" inside the church for more than three hours. Maria, a member of the Assyrian community, told Guardian Australia that those present outside the church following the attack were \"reacting to what they were seeing on social media\". \"There were many inflammatory posts making the rounds, people advocating for violence and such,\" she said. \"It was making lots of people very angry.\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has convened an emergency meeting of national security agencies, calling the attack \"disturbing\". \"We're a peace-loving nation... There's no place for violent extremism,\" he said. Trying to quell further violence, he urged that people \"not take the law into their own hands\". Questioned about the role that social media played in Monday night's events, Mr Albanese said he \"remained concerned\" about it. The government has told Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp - as well as X, formerly known as Twitter - to remove offensive content relating to the attack from their platforms within 24 hours or face potential fines."

          "summary": "Gunmen stormed a rock concert near Moscow, killing at least 90 people and wounding more than 100 others. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, and U.S. officials confirmed the claim. Eleven people have been detained in connection with the attack. The assailants fired automatic rifles and tossed what was either a hand grenade or incendiary device toward concert-goers from the main entrance of the venue, Crocus City Hall, ahead of a performance by the Russian band Picnic. The building was set alight during the attack, and images from the scene showed flames and heavy smoke billowing out from the building. Multiple videos circulating online showed concert-goers throwing themselves to the floor, hiding behind seats, or running away in search of an exit to the sounds of gunshots and screaming. One video showed four gunmen making their way toward what looked like an exit, with one stopping to fire repeatedly into a group of people huddled together in a corner. Other images circulating on social media showed what appeared to be the bodies of victims, lying amid piles of shattered glass. News of the attack prompted authorities to evacuate malls in Moscow and St. Petersburg as well as cancel public events across the country. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin posted on social media that the attack was a “horrible tragedy,” while Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called it a “bloody terrorist attack.” Ukraine denied it was responsible. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow on March 7 had warned it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts.” The White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that Washington was trying to get more information about the incident, but noted that the “images were just horrible.” “Our thoughts obviously are going to be with the victims of this terrible, terrible shooting attack,” he said. Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Iran, France, Serbia and Turkey also sent their official condolences."

          "summary": "Payton Gendron, a 19-year-old White man, pleaded guilty to state charges of domestic terrorism as a hate crime, murder and attempted murder for the shooting at Tops Friendly Markets on May 14, killing 10 people and wounding three.  Gendron admitted to using an illegally modified semiautomatic rifle to target people because they were Black, and chose the store because it was in a predominantly Black neighborhood. He faces multiple federal hate crime charges, which carry the potential for the death penalty, in addition to several firearms charges. The event has led to discussions about gun control and racism in the United States."
